## Hi There, I'm Rajat ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a software developer for a startup that specializes in **building SaaS solutions**. Working in this environment has given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.

I am proud to be a part of a team that is passionate about creating high-quality software that delivers real value to our customers.

I am also a senior college student pursuing a **Bachelor's in Technology** in IT. I am also proud to have participated in the **Google Summer of Code** program with **Jenkins X**.

Recently, I joined the **CDF ambassador team**, where I have continued to expand my knowledge and skills within the field of IT. I am excited to share my journey and experiences with others, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as I move forward in my career.
