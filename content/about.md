## Hello, I'm Rajat 👋🏼

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate learning about software fundamentals.
Currently, I'm focused on Jenkins X UI🎯.

Jenkins X UI was my **Google Summer of Code** Project as mentee. 
During that I was introduced to Kubernetes, CRDs, Tekton, Kubebuilder, various GitOps Tools, Best Practices, CNCF and CDF Projects and there maintainers.
I'm also a Maintainer in training (that's what we like to call it).
In short, I'm an Open Source Enthusiast😁.

If I'm not working you will find me playing outdoor⚽.

If you want to get in touch, I’m most responsive over email and I tend to be pretty active on Twitter as well💬.

Most recently, I worked for a startup [thoughtz.ai]([thoughtz.ai]) as a **Full stack Developer**. 
During my college I worked as a **Project Committee Chairperson** at **IEEE MSIT** and I've also won **Linux Foundation Training Scholarship**🚀.
